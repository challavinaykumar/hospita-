                            <p><b>1. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA):</b> <span> Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, commonly known as PTCA, is a minimally invasive procedure designed to treat coronary artery disease. Our expert cardiologists employ this technique to widen narrowed or obstructed coronary arteries, restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. During PTCA, a catheter with a balloon at its tip is inserted into the narrowed artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated, compressing the plaque against the artery walls and creating a larger opening. In some cases, a stent may be placed to help maintain the arteryâ€™s patency. This procedure offers a less invasive alternative to traditional surgery and often allows for a quicker recovery.</span></p>

                            <p><b>2. Coronary Angiogram:</b> <span>A Coronary Angiogram is a diagnostic procedure that provides detailed images of the coronary arteries and helps identify any blockages or abnormalities. During this procedure, a contrast dye is injected into the coronary arteries, and X-ray images are taken to visualize the blood flow and identify areas of concern. The information obtained from a coronary angiogram is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Our experienced team at Asian Vascular Hospital ensures that this procedure is conducted with precision and efficiency, offering valuable insights into your cardiovascular health.</span></p>
