                        <p>Peripheral angioplasty and stenting represent a cornerstone of our Endovascular Arterial Procedures, designed to treat conditions affecting the arteries outside the heart and brain. Our skilled team of interventional vascular specialists employs minimally invasive techniques to restore blood flow, alleviate pain, and improve overall vascular health.</p>

                        <p>Peripheral angioplasty involves the use of a catheter equipped with a balloon to widen narrowed or blocked arteries. This technique enhances blood flow and mitigates symptoms associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Our experts meticulously analyze each case to tailor a customized treatment plan, ensuring optimal outcomes for every patient.</p>
                        <p>In cases where the arterial blockage is more complex, stenting may be recommended. A stent is a small, mesh-like tube inserted into the artery to support its walls and maintain an open pathway for blood flow. Asian Vascular Hospital boasts a comprehensive range of stent options, allowing our specialists to choose the most suitable one for each patientâ€™s unique anatomy and condition.</p>
